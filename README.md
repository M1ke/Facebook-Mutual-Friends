# Facebook Mutual Friends

I couldn't find anything available online when I wanted to see who I had the most friends in common with on Facebook, so I wrote a quick app in JavaScript to do just that.

## Installation

Just insert your App ID where provided (I've helpfully put in a dummy variable so the script will crash if you forget) and you're away to play with it.

## License

Free, but it would be cool if you mentioned me in anything you make out of it, or at least tweet me a link to it.
