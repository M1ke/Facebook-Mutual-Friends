# Facebook Mutual Friends

I couldn't find anything available online when I wanted to see who I had the most friends in common with on Facebook, so I wrote a quick app in JavaScript to do just that.

## Installation

Just insert your App ID where provided (I've helpfully put in a dummy variable so the script will crash if you forget) and you're away to play with it. It will load jQuery and the Facebook SDK remotely. The jQuery files are taken from Google's CDN with a fallback; put the file in `scripts/libs`. As of writing this it uses 1.7.1 but any version will do.

## License

Free, but it would be cool if you mentioned me in anything you make out of it, or at least tweet me a link to it.
